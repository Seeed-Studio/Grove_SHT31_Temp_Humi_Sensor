[Grove - Temperature&Humidity Sensor (SHT31)](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Temperature%26Humidity-Sensor-(SHT31)-p-2655.html)

Grove - Temp&Humi Sensor(SHT31) is a highly reliable, accurate, quick response and integrated temperature & humidity sensor. The sensor(chip) used in the module is designed with Sensirion's CMOSens® technology. The chip is well calibrated, linearized and compensated for digital output.

The typical accuracy of this module can be ±2%RH (for relative humidity) and ±0.3°C (for temperature). This module is compatible with 3.3 Volts and 5 Volts and hence does not require a voltage level shifter. This module communicates using with I2C serial bus and can work up to 1 MHz speed. We also have provided a highly abstracted library to make this product more easier to use.
